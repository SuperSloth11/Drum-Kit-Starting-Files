# Drum-Kit-Starting-Files

This project is from Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course, "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp".  I am taking this course, and many others, to learn web development so I can change careers.  The main topic of this lesson was Event Listeners and an introduction to callback functions.  

Thank you for looking.
